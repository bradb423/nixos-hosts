# Useful Development Shells

This directory contains a list of useful shells which I use for development.

When starting off a project (for example, a Haskell project), it may be useful
to quickly copy the relevant shell into your working directory. Eg:

```bash
> cp ~/nixos-hosts/shells/haskell.nix $(pwd)/shell.nix
> nix-shell
```
